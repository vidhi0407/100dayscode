Q104: Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, x, totalSum, leftSum;
    printf("Enter a positive integer n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    totalSum = n * (n + 1) / 2; 

    int pivot = -1;

    for (x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        leftSum = x * (x + 1) / 2;  
        int rightSum = totalSum - leftSum + x; 
        if (leftSum == rightSum) {
            pivot = x;
            break;
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", pivot);
    return 0;
}
